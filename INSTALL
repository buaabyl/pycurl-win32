NOTE: You need Python and libcurl installed on your system to use or
build pycurl.  Some RPM distributions of curl/libcurl do not include
everything necessary to build pycurl, in which case you need to
install the developer specific RPM which is usually called curl-dev.


Distutils
---------

Build and install pycurl with the following commands:

    (if necessary, become root)
    tar -zxvf pycurl-$VER.tar.gz
    cd pycurl-$VER
    python setup.py install

$VER should be substituted with the pycurl version number, e.g. 7.10.5.

Note that the installation script assumes that 'curl-config' can be
located in your path setting.  If curl-config is installed outside
your path or you want to force installation to use a particular
version of curl-config, use the '--curl-config' commandline option to
specify the location of curl-config.  Example:

    python setup.py install --curl-config=/usr/local/bin/curl-config

If libcurl is linked dynamically with pycurl, you may have to alter the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable accordingly.  This normally
applies only if there is more than one version of libcurl installed,
e.g. one in /usr/lib and one in /usr/local/lib.


Windows
-------

First, you will need to obtain dependencies. These can be precompiled binaries
or source packages that you are going to compile yourself.

For a minimum build you will just need libcurl source. Follow its Windows
build instructions to build either a static or a DLL version of the library,
then configure PycURL as follows to use it:

    python setup.py --curl-dir=c:\dev\curl-7.33.0\builds\libcurl-vc-x86-release-dll-ipv6-sspi-spnego-winssl

Note that --curl-dir does not point to libcurl source but rather to headers
and compiled libraries.

A good setup.py target to use is bdist_wininst which produces an executable
installer that you can run to install PycURL.
