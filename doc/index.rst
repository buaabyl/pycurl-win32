PycURL -- A Python Interface To The cURL library
================================================

PycURL is a Python interface to `libcurl`_, the multiprotocol file
transfer library. Similarly to the urllib_ Python module,
PycURL can be used to fetch objects identified by a URL from a Python program.
Beyond simple fetches however PycURL exposes most of the functionality of
libcurl, including:

- Speed - libcurl is very fast and PycURL, being a thin wrapper above
  libcurl, is very fast as well. PycURL `was benchmarked`_ to be several
  times faster than requests_.
- Features including multiple protocol support, SSL, authentication and
  proxy options. PycURL supports most of libcurl's callbacks.
- Multi_ and share_ interfaces.
- Sockets used for network operations, permitting integration of PycURL
  into the application's I/O loop (e.g., using Tornado_).

  authentication  (Basic, Digest, NTLM, Negotiate, Kerberos4), file transfer
  resume, http proxy tunneling and more!

- libcurl is highly portable, it builds and works identically on numerous
  platforms, including Solaris, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin, HPUX, IRIX,
  AIX, Tru64, Linux, UnixWare, HURD, Windows, Amiga, OS/2, BeOs, Mac OS X,
  Ultrix, QNX, OpenVMS, RISC OS, Novell NetWare, DOS and more...

- libcurl is `free`_, `thread-safe`_, `IPv6 compatible`_, `feature rich`_,
  `well supported`_, `fast`_, `thoroughly documented`_ and is already used by
  many known, big and successful `companies`_ and numerous `applications`_.

Requirements
------------

- Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.1 through 3.5.
- libcurl 7.19.0 or better.


Installation
------------

On Unix, PycURL is easiest to install using your operating system's package
manager. This will also install libcurl and other dependencies as needed.

Installation via easy_install and pip is also supported::

    easy_install pycurl
    pip install pycurl

If this does not work, please see :ref:`install`.

On Windows, use pip to install a binary wheel for Python 2.6, 2.7 or
3.2 through 3.5::

    pip install pycurl

If not using pip, binary distributions in other formats are available
`on Bintray`_.

Support
-------

For support questions, please use `curl-and-python mailing list`_.
`Mailing list archives`_ are available for your perusal as well.

Although not an official support venue, `Stack Overflow`_ has been
popular with PycURL users as well.

Bugs can be reported `via GitHub`_. Please only use GitHub issues when you are
certain you have found a bug in PycURL. If you do not have a patch to fix
the bug, or at least a specific code fragment in PycURL that you believe is
the cause, you should instead post your inquiry to the mailing list.
